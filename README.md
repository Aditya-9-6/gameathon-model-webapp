# ⚡ IronWall+ — Gamethon Demo

> Real-time cyberpunk network defense game. Judges attack, IronWall blocks, the crowd watches. Now with local streaming AI.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo (Cloud Deployment)

The project is deployed on Render and ready to test instantly:

- 🛡️ **Defense Grid (Big Screen)**: [ironwall-frontend.onrender.com](https://ironwall-frontend.onrender.com)
- 🗡️ **Attacker Panel (Phone)**: [ironwall-frontend.onrender.com/attacker.html](https://ironwall-frontend.onrender.com/attacker.html)

No installation required! Just open the links and start attacking.

---

## Local Quick Start (Optional)

### 1. Start the Rust backend
```powershell
cd backend
cargo run
```
Server starts on two ports:
- `ws://localhost:9001/ws` → WebSocket telemetry (game board)
- `http://localhost:8080`  → Pingora proxy (attack interception)

### 2. Open the frontend
Open both files directly in a browser (no build step needed):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `frontend/index.html` | **Main Game Board** — project on the big screen |
| `frontend/attacker.html` | **Judge Controller** — open on phone / second tab |

---

## Architecture

```
Judge phone (attacker.html)
        │  WebSocket payload
        ▼
[LAYER 1] Pingora Proxy :8080
        │  ThreatDictionary.classify() — < 1µs RegEx
        │  BLOCKED? → drop + broadcast event
        │  SAFE?    → forward to Core Server
        ▼
[LAYER 2] axum WebSocket :9001
        │  tokio broadcast channel
        ▼
Game Board (index.html)  ←── live telemetry
  Canvas animations + WebGL glitch shader
```

## 🎮 Gamification & Educational Mechanics

IronWall+ is uniquely gamified for an engaging hackathon presentation:

1. **Hacker Progression System**: The Attacker Panel features an RPG-like leveling system. Users start as "Script Kiddies" and must land attacks to earn EXP, eventually unlocking advanced payloads (DDoS, Zero-Days).
2. **Vulnerability Patch Quizzes**: Upon catching an attack type for the first time, IronWall+ interrupts the Defense Grid with a multiple-choice pop-up quiz testing the defender on how to properly patch the root vulnerability in the source code.
3. **Phishing Simulator**: A simulated email client periodically appears on the defense board; the presenter must identify whether a payload is legitimate or phishing to earn bonus security points (or trigger a massive system compromise).

## Attack Payloads (what each button fires)

| Button | Attack Type | Severity |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 💉 SQL: Tautology | `SQL_INJECTION` | 85 |
| 🔗 SQL: Union-Based | `SQL_INJECTION` | 90 |
| ⏱ SQL: Blind/Time | `SQL_INJECTION` | 82 |
| 🕸️ XSS: Reflected | `XSS_INJECTION` | 80 |
| 💾 XSS: Stored | `XSS_INJECTION` | 95 |
| 📂 Path Traversal (Linux) | `PATH_TRAVERSAL` | 75 |
| 🪟 Path Traversal (Windows) | `PATH_TRAVERSAL` | 75 |
| 🌊 DDoS: SYN Flood | `DDOS_SWARM` | 95 |
| 🔊 DDoS: UDP Amp | `DDOS_SWARM` | 98 |
| ☢️ Zero-Day Mutator | `ZERO_DAY_MUTATOR` | 100 |
| 🌌 Mirror Probe | `MIRROR_PROBE` | 60 |
| 🎣 Phishing | (simulator) | — |
